# 🏦 ATM Simulation System (Python)

This is a simple **ATM (Automated Teller Machine) Simulation System** built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
It allows users to **create accounts, generate PINs, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, view transaction history, and change their PIN securely.**

---

## 📘 Project Overview
- Demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  
- User can perform **secure banking operations** in the simulation.  
- Emphasis on **PIN security** (using `getpass`).

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔑 **PIN Generation & Verification** using secure input (`getpass` module).  
- 💰 **Deposit Money** into the account.  
- 💸 **Withdraw Money** with:
  - Maximum withdrawal limit of **₹10,000** at once.  
  - Minimum balance requirement of **₹3000**.  
- 📊 **Check Account Balance** anytime.  
- 📑 **Transaction History** to track deposits & withdrawals.  
- 🔄 **Change PIN** securely.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Concepts:** OOP (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)  
- **Modules:** `getpass`, `datetime`

## 📖 Key Concepts Practiced

- 🔒 **Encapsulation & Secure PIN Handling**  
  PIN input is taken securely using the `getpass` module instead of plain text, ensuring privacy.  

- 🏗️ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Design**  
  The project is built around **classes & objects**, showing modularity and reusability of code.  

- 👨‍💻 **User Interaction Simulation**  
  Provides an interactive ATM-like experience where users can perform real banking operations in a simulated environment.
