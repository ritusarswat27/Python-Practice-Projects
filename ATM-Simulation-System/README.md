🏦 ATM Simulation System (Python)

This is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) Simulation System built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It allows users to create accounts, generate PINs, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, view transaction history, and change their PIN securely.

📘 Project Overview

Demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

User can perform secure banking operations in the simulation.

Emphasis on PIN security (using getpass).

✨ Features

🔑 PIN Generation & Verification using secure input (getpass module).

💰 Deposit Money into the account.

💸 Withdraw Money with:

Maximum withdrawal limit of ₹10,000 at once.

Minimum balance requirement of ₹3000.

📊 Check Account Balance anytime.

📑 Transaction History to track deposits & withdrawals.

🔄 Change PIN securely.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Python 3

Concepts: OOP (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)

Modules: getpass, datetime

🚀 How to Run
