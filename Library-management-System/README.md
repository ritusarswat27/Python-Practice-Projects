# 📚 Library Management System  

A beginner-friendly **Library Management System** built in Python 🐍 that demonstrates the power of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
This project is **menu-driven** and allows managing books and users with basic functionalities like issuing, returning, and viewing books.

- 📖 **Add New Books** → Add books with a title and author.  
- 👤 **Register Users** → Create and maintain user records.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Practiced  

This project is not just functional, but also educational. It helps in understanding:  

- 🔐 **Encapsulation** → Book status (`Issued` / `Available`) is protected.  
- 🏗️ **Object-Oriented Design** →  
  - `Book` class → Represents each book with title, author, and status.  
  - `User` class → Represents a user with books they have issued.  
  - `Library` class → Handles the entire system (adding, issuing, returning books).  
- 🔄 **User Interaction Simulation** → Console menu mimics a real-world library workflow.  
- 🧾 **Data Handling** → Uses lists for storing books and users effectively.
